This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug and its solution.  The bug arises from attempting to access a property of an object before it has been properly populated with data from an asynchronous operation.  The solution shows how to implement proper null and undefined checks to prevent the error.  The example utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing asynchronous data fetching and component state.
